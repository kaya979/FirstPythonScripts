#Create a new script.
#Copy the code below into your script.
#for i in range(10):
#     do something here
#Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. 
# Figure out how its value is determined.
#Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
#Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations

    #range(5) means there will be 5 repetitions starting from 0
    print(i*x)
    

# de regel begint altijd bij 0.
# de regels worden steeds 5 hoger
# er zijn 10 regels (the range is predetermined number of iterations)
