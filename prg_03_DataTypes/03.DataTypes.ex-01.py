#Exercise 01
#Create a new script.
#Copy the code below into your script.
#Programming languages make use of data types to tell the computer how to interpret those strings


a = 'int'           #double or single quotations are called string 
b = 7               #numbers are called integers
c = False           #"false" or "true" are called  Boolean
d = 18.5            #decimal numbers are called floating_points

print(a, ":what is the type of a? a is of type:", type(a)) #print(type(x)) shows class type of variable x
print(b, "is of type", type(b))
print(c , "is of type", type(c))
print(d, "is of type", type(d))


#adding two variables b and d
x = b + d
print("This is text; If you add variables b and d it gives us", x, "which is of type", type(x))
